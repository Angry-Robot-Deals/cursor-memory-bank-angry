# QUALITY RULES (Rules #10-12)

> **Quality practices for REFLECT and PLAN modes. Focus: focused review, clear scope, verification.**

## 📋 CATEGORY OVERVIEW

| Rule | Name | Key Practice | Apply When |
|------|------|--------------|------------|
| #10 | **Focused Review** | One method at a time | Code review |
| #11 | **Boundaries** | State what's excluded | Planning |
| #12 | **Complexity Check** | Verify solvability | Before starting |

## 🔟 FOCUSED REVIEW RULE (#10)

### One-Liner
> Review ONE method at a time, not entire feature. Narrow focus = better review.

### Quick Application

```markdown
## REVIEW: [Method Name] Only

### Code Quality
- [ ] Logic clear at first glance?
- [ ] Single responsibility?
- [ ] Method < 50 lines?
- [ ] ≤7-9 objects in scope?

### Correctness
- [ ] All DoD tests pass?
- [ ] Edge cases handled?
- [ ] Errors handled?

### Safety
- [ ] No race conditions?
- [ ] Transaction isolation correct?
- [ ] No memory leaks?

### Verdict
□ ✅ APPROVED
□ ⚠️ MINOR CHANGES
□ ❌ REQUIRES CHANGES
```

### Why Focused?

```
Review Scope     | Bugs Found | Time
─────────────────┼────────────┼──────
One method       | 40% more   | Less
Entire feature   | Baseline   | More
500+ line PR     | 40% fewer  | Much more
```

## 1️⃣1️⃣ BOUNDARIES RULE (#11)

### One-Liner
> Explicitly state what is OUT OF SCOPE to prevent scope creep and wasted effort.

### Quick Application

```markdown
## Task Scope

### ✅ What We DO
- Feature A
- Feature B
- Feature C

### ❌ What We DON'T Do (Out of Scope)
- Optimization (separate task)
- Caching (future enhancement)
- Analytics (different service)
- Migration of old data (manual)
```

### Benefits

```
With Boundaries     | Without Boundaries
────────────────────┼────────────────────
Focused work        | Scope creep
Clear completion    | Unclear when done
No wasted tokens    | AI explores wrong paths
Predictable time    | Unpredictable delays
```

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ COMPLEXITY CHECK RULE (#12)

### One-Liner
> Before starting, verify AI can solve this task. Check dependencies and success criteria.

### Quick Application

```markdown
## COMPLEXITY CHECK

### Solvability Questions
- [ ] Can AI solve this in one session?
- [ ] Are all dependencies known?
- [ ] Is there clear success criteria (tests)?
- [ ] Is code volume < 500 lines total?
- [ ] No too many new concepts at once?

### 🚩 Red Flags (Too Complex)
- "Implement entire microservice"
- "Optimize compiler"
- "Create ML model from scratch"
- "Redesign entire architecture"

### ✅ Appropriate Scope
- "Implement addItem() method"
- "Create Storage interface"
- "Add validation to form"
- "Fix null pointer in X function"
```

### Complexity Decision

```
If too complex:
├── Break into smaller tasks
├── Add more context/examples
├── Ask human for critical parts
└── Use creative phase for design
```
