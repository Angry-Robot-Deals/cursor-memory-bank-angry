# RULE #11: TASK BOUNDARIES

> **Goal:** Prevent scope creep and wasted effort by explicitly stating what is NOT included.

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLE

**Explicitly define what is OUT OF SCOPE. Negative constraints are as important as positive requirements.**

Without boundaries, AI (and humans) will expand scope indefinitely. Clear exclusions focus effort.

---

## 📋 RULE SPECIFICATION

```yaml
BOUNDARIES_RULE:
  format: "Explicit 'What we DON'T do' section"
  placement: "Every task definition, every prompt"
  categories:
    - features_excluded: "Features not in this task"
    - optimization_excluded: "Performance work for later"
    - refactoring_excluded: "Code cleanup not now"
    - edge_cases_excluded: "Edge cases for future"
  benefit: "50% reduction in scope creep"
```

---

## ✅ HOW TO APPLY

### In Task Definition

```markdown
## Task: Implement Like System

### ✅ What We DO
- Add like functionality for videos
- Track unique likes by IP address
- Return like count after adding
- Handle duplicate like attempts gracefully

### ❌ What We DON'T Do (Out of Scope)
- Unlike functionality (separate task #124)
- Like animations in UI (design task)
- Like count caching (optimization task)
- Analytics/tracking of likes (analytics team)
- Notification when video gets likes (notifications service)
- Rate limiting for likes (infrastructure task)
- Migration of existing like data (DBA task)
```

### In Implementation Prompts

```markdown
## Implement addLike() Method

### Requirements
- Insert like if not exists
- Return {added: bool, count: number}

### Boundaries
- We DON'T implement unlike()
- We DON'T add caching
- We DON'T handle analytics
- We DON'T optimize for performance yet

### Just implement the basic addLike functionality.
```

### In Code Review

```markdown
## Review: addLike() Implementation

### Review Scope
- Only review addLike() logic
- Only check basic functionality

### Out of Scope for This Review
- Performance optimization suggestions
- Refactoring of surrounding code
- Feature suggestions (unlike, etc.)
- Architecture improvements
```

## 📊 BOUNDARY CATEGORIES

### Feature Boundaries
What features are NOT included.

```markdown
### ❌ Features Out of Scope
- [Feature A] - Planned for Phase 2
- [Feature B] - Requires design approval
- [Feature C] - Different team responsibility
- [Feature D] - Not in current sprint
```

### Technical Boundaries
What technical work is NOT included.

```markdown
### ❌ Technical Out of Scope
- Performance optimization (after MVP)
- Code refactoring (tech debt backlog)
- Infrastructure changes (ops team)
- Database migration (DBA approval needed)
- Test coverage improvements (QA sprint)
```

### Time Boundaries
What won't be done in this iteration.

```markdown
### ❌ Not in This Iteration
- Edge case X (handle in v1.1)
- Feature enhancement Y (next sprint)
- Bug fix Z (separate ticket)
```

### Quality Boundaries
What quality level is acceptable now.

```markdown
### ❌ Quality Aspects Deferred
- 100% test coverage (80% acceptable for now)
- Full documentation (basic docs sufficient)
- Performance benchmarks (defer to optimization phase)
```

## 📋 BOUNDARY TEMPLATE

```markdown
## Task: [Task Name]

### ✅ IN SCOPE (What We Do)
1. [Specific deliverable 1]
2. [Specific deliverable 2]
3. [Specific deliverable 3]

### ❌ OUT OF SCOPE (What We Don't Do)

#### Features Excluded
- [Feature] - Reason: [Why excluded]
- [Feature] - Reason: [Why excluded]

#### Technical Work Excluded
- [Tech work] - Reason: [Why excluded]
- [Tech work] - Reason: [Why excluded]

#### Deferred Items
- [Item] - Will be done: [When/ticket#]
- [Item] - Will be done: [When/ticket#]

### Rationale
[Brief explanation of why these boundaries exist]

## 📊 BENEFITS OF BOUNDARIES

### Without Boundaries
```
Task: "Implement likes"
AI Response: 
├── Like functionality ✓
├── Unlike functionality (not asked)
├── Like animations (not asked)
├── Caching layer (not asked)
├── Analytics integration (not asked)
├── Email notifications (not asked)
└── 3x scope, 3x time, 3x bugs
```

### With Boundaries
```
Task: "Implement likes"
Boundaries: "NOT: unlike, animations, caching, analytics"
AI Response:
├── Like functionality ✓
└── Done. Clean, focused, correct.
```

## ⚠️ COMMON SCOPE CREEP TRIGGERS

### Trigger → Boundary Response

| Trigger | AI Tendency | Boundary |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| "Make it work" | Add all features | "Only basic functionality" |
| "Handle errors" | Every possible error | "Only listed error cases" |
| "Optimize" | Premature optimization | "Basic implementation first" |
| "Clean code" | Massive refactoring | "Only new code quality" |
| "Good UX" | Animations, polish | "Functional UI only" |

### Boundary Phrasing

```markdown
# Strong Boundaries (Clear, Specific)
- ❌ We DON'T implement unlike functionality
- ❌ We DON'T add caching
- ❌ We DON'T refactor existing code

# Weak Boundaries (Vague, Ignorable)
- Maybe later: unlike
- Could add caching
- Consider refactoring
```

## 🔄 BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT

### In Planning
```markdown
## Task Planning Checklist
- [ ] Scope defined (what we do)
- [ ] Boundaries defined (what we don't)
- [ ] Rationale for boundaries documented
- [ ] Stakeholders agree on boundaries
```

### In Implementation
```markdown
## Before Each Prompt
"Remember: We're NOT doing [X, Y, Z] in this task.
Focus only on [A, B, C]."
```

### In Review
```markdown
## Review Scope Check
- Is implementation within boundaries?
- Were any out-of-scope items added?
- Are boundaries still appropriate?
```

---

## ⚠️ ANTI-PATTERNS

### ❌ Don't: No Boundaries
```markdown
"Implement user authentication"
// AI might build entire auth system with OAuth, SSO, 2FA, etc.
```

### ❌ Don't: Vague Boundaries
```markdown
"Don't do too much"
// Subjective, will be ignored
```

### ❌ Don't: Hidden Boundaries
```markdown
// Only in your head, not written down
// AI doesn't know, scope creep happens
```

### ✅ Do: Explicit Boundaries
```markdown
"Implement password login only.
❌ NOT: OAuth, SSO, 2FA, password reset, account lockout.
These are separate tasks #125-129."
```

---

## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before starting work:

```
□ In-scope items clearly listed
□ Out-of-scope items explicitly stated
□ Reasons for exclusions documented
□ Deferred items tracked (ticket numbers)
□ Boundaries are specific, not vague
□ All stakeholders agree on boundaries
□ Boundaries included in prompts
```
