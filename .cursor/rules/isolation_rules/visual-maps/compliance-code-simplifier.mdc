# COMPLIANCE: CODE SIMPLIFIER (Step 2)

**Self-contained in .cursor.** Project standards: use project style-guide or .cursor rules if present.

## Scope

Apply only to **recently modified code** (files from Git diff or Memory Bank change set). Do not refactor the entire codebase.

## Principles

1. **Preserve functionality** — Do not change what the code does; only how it does it.
2. **Apply project standards** — Use project style guide (e.g. style-guide.md in project) if present; otherwise follow `.cursor` rules and project conventions (imports, naming, error handling).
3. **Enhance clarity** — Reduce nesting; eliminate redundant code; clear variable/function names; **no nested ternaries** (prefer switch or if/else); choose clarity over brevity.
4. **Maintain balance** — Avoid over-simplification; do not combine too many concerns; keep code debuggable and extendable.
5. **Scope** — Focus on recently modified code only unless the user instructs otherwise.

## Process

1. Identify recently modified code sections (from compliance workflow step 1 output).
2. Analyze for clarity and consistency opportunities.
3. Apply project standards and the principles above.
4. Ensure functionality remains unchanged.
5. Document only significant changes in the compliance report (Step 2 summary).

## Do not

- Change behaviour or outputs.
- Use nested ternaries or overly dense one-liners.
- Remove helpful abstractions that improve organization.
- Expand scope beyond recently modified code without explicit instruction.
