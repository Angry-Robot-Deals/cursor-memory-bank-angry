# RULE #10: FOCUSED CODE REVIEW

> **Goal:** Find 40% more bugs by reviewing one method at a time instead of entire features.

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLE

**Review ONE method at a time, not entire files or features. Narrow focus = better review.**

Broad reviews miss details. Focused reviews catch subtle bugs.


## 📋 RULE SPECIFICATION

```yaml
FOCUSED_REVIEW_RULE:
  scope: "Single method per review"
  prohibition: "Do NOT review entire files at once"
  format: "Checklist-based review"
  categories:
    - correctness: "Logic and behavior"
    - quality: "Code quality metrics"
    - safety: "Security and error handling"
  output: "APPROVED / MINOR_CHANGES / MAJOR_CHANGES"
  benefit: "40% more bugs found than broad review"
```


## 📊 REVIEW EFFECTIVENESS

| Review Scope | Bugs Found | Time | Fatigue |
|--------------|------------|------|---------|
| One method | 40% more | Less | Low |
| 3-5 methods | Baseline | Medium | Medium |
| Entire file | 20% fewer | More | High |
| 500+ lines | 40% fewer | Longest | Very High |

### Why Focused?
```
Broad Review:
├── Attention spread thin
├── Important details missed
├── Reviewer fatigue
└── "Looks good" without deep analysis

Focused Review:
├── Deep dive into one thing
├── Every line examined
├── Edge cases considered
└── Actionable feedback
```

## 🔍 REVIEW EXAMPLE

### Code Under Review

```typescript
async function addLike(videoId: string, ipAddress: string): Promise<LikeResult> {
  return await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
    const existing = await tx.query(
      'SELECT id FROM likes WHERE video_id = $1 AND ip_address = $2',
      [videoId, ipAddress]
    );
    
    if (existing.rows.length > 0) {
      const count = await getCount(tx, videoId);
      return { added: false, count };
    }
    
    await tx.query(
      'INSERT INTO likes (video_id, ip_address) VALUES ($1, $2)',
      [videoId, ipAddress]
    );
    
    const count = await getCount(tx, videoId);
    return { added: true, count };
  });
}
```

### Review Output

```markdown
## Method Review: addLike

### 1. CORRECTNESS ✅
- [x] Logic matches requirements - dedup by IP
- [x] Edge cases handled - returns false for duplicate
- [x] Return values correct

### 2. QUALITY ✅
- [x] Method ~20 lines
- [x] 6 objects in scope (tx, existing, count, videoId, ipAddress, result)
- [x] Single responsibility - add like

### 3. SAFETY ⚠️
- [x] Parameterized queries - no SQL injection
- [ ] **ISSUE: No input validation for videoId/ipAddress**
- [ ] **ISSUE: Transaction isolation not specified**

### 4. PERFORMANCE ✅
- [x] No N+1 queries
- [x] Efficient index usage expected

### VERDICT: ⚠️ MINOR CHANGES

### FINDINGS
1. No input validation - null/empty ipAddress would cause issues
2. Transaction isolation level not specified - race condition possible

### RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Add: `if (!ipAddress) throw new Error('IP required')`
2. Add: `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE`
```


## ⚠️ ANTI-PATTERNS

### ❌ Don't: Review Everything at Once
```markdown
"Review this entire 500-line file"
```
Result: Shallow review, bugs missed

### ❌ Don't: Rubber-Stamp
```markdown
"Looks good to me" (without checking)
```
Result: Bugs slip through

### ❌ Don't: Review Without Tests
```markdown
"Review this method" (no tests provided)
```
Result: Can't verify correctness

### ✅ Do: Focused Review
```markdown
"Review ONLY addLike() method against these tests"
```
Result: Thorough analysis, actionable feedback
