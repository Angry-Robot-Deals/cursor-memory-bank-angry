# RULE #12: COMPLEXITY CHECK

> **Goal:** Verify task is solvable by AI before starting. Don't waste time on impossible tasks.

## 🎯 CORE PRINCIPLE

**Before starting, verify: Can AI actually solve this? Are dependencies clear? Is success measurable?**

Some tasks are beyond AI capability. Identify them early to adjust approach or involve humans.


## 📋 RULE SPECIFICATION

```yaml
COMPLEXITY_CHECK_RULE:
  when: "Before starting ANY task"
  questions:
    - solvable: "Can AI solve this in one session?"
    - dependencies: "Are all dependencies known?"
    - success: "Is there clear success criteria (tests)?"
    - volume: "Is code volume reasonable (<500 lines)?"
    - novelty: "Not too many new concepts at once?"
  outcomes:
    - PROCEED: "All questions answered YES"
    - DECOMPOSE: "Task too large, break down"
    - HUMAN_INPUT: "Need human for critical parts"
    - CREATIVE_PHASE: "Need design decisions first"
```


## ✅ THE SOLVABILITY CHECKLIST

```markdown
## Complexity Check: [Task Name]

### 1. SOLVABILITY
Can AI solve this in one focused session?
- [ ] Task is well-defined
- [ ] No ambiguous requirements
- [ ] No research needed during implementation
- [ ] Similar problems solved before

### 2. DEPENDENCIES
Are all inputs and dependencies known?
- [ ] Input data format is specified
- [ ] Output format is specified
- [ ] External services documented
- [ ] No unknown APIs to learn

### 3. SUCCESS CRITERIA
Can success be objectively measured?
- [ ] Tests can be written
- [ ] Expected outputs are concrete
- [ ] Edge cases are defined
- [ ] No subjective criteria ("good performance")

### 4. VOLUME
Is the implementation size reasonable?
- [ ] Estimated < 500 lines of new code
- [ ] Fits in one context window
- [ ] Can be reviewed in one pass
- [ ] No massive data structures

### 5. NOVELTY
Are concepts familiar enough?
- [ ] Using known languages/frameworks
- [ ] No bleeding-edge technologies
- [ ] Pattern is well-established
- [ ] Documentation exists for tools used

### VERDICT
- [ ] ✅ PROCEED - Task is solvable
- [ ] ⚠️ DECOMPOSE - Break into smaller tasks
- [ ] 🧑 HUMAN INPUT - Need human for parts
- [ ] 🎨 CREATIVE FIRST - Need design decisions
```


## 🚩 RED FLAGS (Too Complex)

### Instant Red Flags
These phrases indicate task is too complex:

```
❌ "Implement entire [system]"
   → Break into components

❌ "Optimize [complex algorithm]"
   → Need benchmarks and profiling first

❌ "Create [ML model] from scratch"
   → Need specialized tools/expertise

❌ "Redesign entire architecture"
   → Need creative phase and planning

❌ "Make it like [complex product]"
   → Need feature breakdown

❌ "Handle all edge cases"
   → Need specific edge case list

❌ "Make it production-ready"
   → Vague, need specific criteria
```

### Complexity Indicators

| Indicator | Score | Action |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Clear single function | 1 | ✅ Proceed |
| Multiple related methods | 2 | ✅ Proceed |
| New class/module | 3 | ⚠️ Consider skeleton first |
| Integration with external | 4 | ⚠️ Need API docs |
| Multiple new concepts | 5 | ⚠️ Break down |
| Architecture change | 6+ | 🎨 Creative phase first |


## ✅ APPROPRIATE SCOPE EXAMPLES

### ✅ Good: Solvable Tasks

```markdown
✅ "Implement addItem() method that inserts to database"
   - Single method, clear input/output
   - Database pattern is standard
   - Tests can verify

✅ "Create Storage interface with CRUD operations"
   - Known pattern (CRUD)
   - Interface is documentation
   - No implementation logic

✅ "Add validation to email field"
   - Single responsibility
   - Regex patterns are known
   - Easy to test

✅ "Fix null pointer in getUserById()"
   - Specific location
   - Clear bug
   - Easy to verify fix
```

### ❌ Bad: Unsolvable as Single Task

```markdown
❌ "Build a social media platform"
   → Needs months of work, many features

❌ "Write a compiler for this language"
   → Extremely complex, specialized knowledge

❌ "Make the app 10x faster"
   → Need profiling, benchmarks, analysis first

❌ "Implement authentication"
   → Vague: OAuth? SAML? JWT? Password?
```


## 📊 DECISION MATRIX

```
                    DEPENDENCIES
                    Clear   Unclear
SCOPE         ─────────────────────────
Small         │ ✅ GO   │ ⚠️ CLARIFY │
              │         │            │
Large         │ ✅ DECOMPOSE │ 🎨 CREATIVE │
              │              │            │
─────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Decision Flow

```
1. Is scope small and clear?
   YES → Check dependencies
   NO  → Decompose first

2. Are dependencies clear?
   YES → Check success criteria
   NO  → Clarify before starting

3. Is success measurable?
   YES → PROCEED
   NO  → Define tests/DoD first
```


## 🔧 WHEN TO DECOMPOSE

### Signs You Need to Break Down

```markdown
DECOMPOSE WHEN:
├── Task has "and" in description
│   → "Implement auth AND authorization AND logging"
│   → 3 separate tasks
│
├── Multiple files affected
│   → "Update all services to use new pattern"
│   → One service at a time
│
├── Estimated > 500 lines
│   → Break into ~100-line chunks
│
├── Multiple unknown APIs
│   → Learn one API first, then use it
│
└── Requires research
    → Research task, then implementation task
```

### Decomposition Template

```markdown
## Original Task
[Large task description]

## Decomposed Tasks

### Task 1: [Foundation]
- What: [Specific deliverable]
- Size: ~100 lines
- Dependencies: None

### Task 2: [Core Logic]
- What: [Specific deliverable]
- Size: ~150 lines
- Dependencies: Task 1

### Task 3: [Integration]
- What: [Specific deliverable]
- Size: ~100 lines
- Dependencies: Tasks 1, 2
```


## ⚠️ ANTI-PATTERNS

### ❌ Don't: Skip the Check
```markdown
"Just start coding, we'll figure it out"
→ Wasted time on impossible tasks
```

### ❌ Don't: Optimistic Estimation
```markdown
"This should be simple..."
→ Usually isn't. Do the checklist.
```

### ❌ Don't: Ignore Red Flags
```markdown
"I know it's complex, but let's try anyway"
→ Set up for failure. Decompose first.
```

### ✅ Do: Honest Assessment
```markdown
"Let me check if this is actually solvable..."
→ Run the checklist, make informed decision
```


## 📋 QUICK REFERENCE

```
BEFORE STARTING ANY TASK:

1. Can AI solve in one session? [Y/N]
2. Are dependencies clear? [Y/N]
3. Is success measurable (tests)? [Y/N]
4. Is code volume < 500 lines? [Y/N]
5. Are concepts familiar? [Y/N]

ALL YES → Proceed
ANY NO  → Address before starting
```


## ✅ VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before starting implementation:

```
□ Solvability checklist completed
□ No red flags present
□ Dependencies are documented
□ Success criteria (tests) exist
□ Volume estimate is reasonable
□ Task is appropriately scoped
□ If too complex: decomposed into subtasks
□ If unclear: got human input
```


*Know if you can win before you fight. Check complexity first.*
