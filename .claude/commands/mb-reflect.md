# Review Implementation (REFLECT Phase)

You are working with the Memory Bank System. Review the completed implementation and document lessons learned.

## Instructions

1. **Review implementation**:
   - Read `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Original plan
   - Review implemented code and tests
   - Compare results against initial requirements

2. **Analyze outcomes**:
   - What worked well?
   - What challenges were encountered?
   - How were problems solved?
   - What would you do differently?

3. **Document lessons learned**:
   - Technical insights
   - Process improvements
   - Patterns discovered
   - Anti-patterns to avoid

4. **Create reflection document**:
   - File: `memory-bank/reflection/reflection-{task_id}.md`
   - Include:
     - Task summary
     - Implementation approach
     - Successes and challenges
     - Lessons learned
     - Recommendations for future

5. **Update Memory Bank files**:
   - `memory-bank/tasks.md` - Add reflection summary
   - `memory-bank/progress.md` - Update phase to REFLECT

6. **Ready for archival** - Task can now be archived

## Memory Bank Integration

- Read from: `memory-bank/tasks.md`, `memory-bank/activeContext.md`, implemented code
- Write to: `memory-bank/reflection/reflection-{task_id}.md`, `memory-bank/tasks.md`
- MCP servers: Use sys8 for timestamps

## Rules to Follow

- Follow all rules in `.claude/rules/memory-bank-paths.md`
- Use MCP servers per `.claude/rules/mcp-integration.md`
- Be honest about challenges and failures
- Focus on learning and improvement

## Example Usage

```
/mb-reflect
```
